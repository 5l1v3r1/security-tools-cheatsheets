			
## MOST USED OPTIONS

# To compile a simple 'C source code' to binary
gcc source_code.c -o binary_name


# Some useful options
			
        -o                      : place the output into <file>
        -m32                    : Cross compilating a 32-bit binary
        -masm=intel             : o/p assembly in 'intel' dialect. Useful when writing inline
                                  assembly code where gcc is by default set to AT&T syntax.

# Security options

        -pie                    : Create a Position Independent Executable (by default this
                                  option is set) (produces ELF LSB shared object)
        -no-pie                 : Don't produce a position independent executable (produces an
                                  ELF LSB executable)

        --fno-stack-protector   : Don't put up canary checks in the binary.


        -nostdlib               : Same as passing '-nostartfiles' and '-nodefaultlibs'. This            	                           disables those 5 "start files" crt*.o (crt0.o, crti.o, crtn.o,
                                  crtbegin.o, crtend.o) that are automatically added to the link
                                  command line.
        -print-file-name=crti.o : Prints the location of the file named 'crti.o'
